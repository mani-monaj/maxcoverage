stagectrl README
------------------------

A minimal controller for Stage, to give a template for building your own controllers.

 - rtv (vaughan@sfu.ca)  2001.10.20

 Instructions
----------------

Assuming Stage is working in your environment (see notes below), you should be able to
build and run this template controller from the directory containing
this README file as follows:

$ cmake .

If you see errors, read the notes below on setting up your environment.

$ make

Check to see that the module "basic.so" has been built successfully
into the current directory. If not, carefully read the build output to
see what went wrong.

Tell Stage to look in the current directory for controller modules

$ export STAGEPATH=.

Now run Stage with the minimal example world.

$ stage basic.world

You should see a world containing one default model, which is running
the basic controller which prints a message on the console and in the
Stage window.

To write your own controller, edit the C++ source file basic.cc. If
you add more source files, you must add them to CMakeLists.txt.

Please let me know of any errors or ommisions. Enjoy writing Stage controllers.


Notes on setting up your environment
--------------------------------------------------

If you installed Stage to the default location for your platform, you
should not need to do any special environment setup.

if you installed Stage to a non-default location, i.e. you specified
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<stage install prefix> when running CMake to
configure Stage, you need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include <stage
install prefix>/lib/pkgconfig since the build script uses pkg-config
to find Stage's compiler and linker settings. You probably also need
to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux,or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on OS X to <stage
install prefix>/lib. If you want toFor convenience, you may also want to add Stage's
the directory containing Stage's binary to your PATH. Here are the
relevant lines from my $HOME/.profile file:

# my install prefix
STAGE=$HOME/stg

export PATH="$STAGE/bin:$PATH"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$STAGE/lib/pkgconfig

#Linux, etc.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$STAGE/lib:.

#OS X
#export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$STAGE/lib:.
